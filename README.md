# A Biomedical Nested NER corpus to support T2KNOW project

This repository contains the code related the models trained using the corpus described in the paper "A Biomedical Nested Named Entity Recognition Corpus for Supporting T2K2NLP".

The files that this repository contains are:
- `trainScript.py`: The script used to train the models.
- `evaluation.py`: The script used to evaluate the models.
- `listaCategorias.txt`: The list of categories used in both scripts. It is used to map the categories to the indexes used in the models.

The corpus is available in [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/12683712).

The models are available in a [Hugging Face collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/edugredu/t2know-models-67862c36aee1dd1f3858bf0d).
